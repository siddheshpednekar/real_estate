		<p class="p1">This initiative aimed to take volunteers beyond office boundaries to<br>reach out to the Differently Abled Children of our society. This<br>initiative was designed to read books to the visually/mentally<br>impaired students from respective schools in Mumbai, Thane &<br>Pune and sensitize volunteers towards persons with disabilities.<br>Volunteers interacted with the students, not only read stories to<br>them but also played games, danced and had a fun time with these<br>special ones that created lasting memories, especially for the<br>volunteers!</p>

		<p class="p2">Focused on 'The Joy of Giving', the Wish Tree initiative aims to fulfill<br>the wishes of children from underprivileged backgrounds. The<br>wishes of these children are shared and the employees are free<br>to select the wish of a child and fulfil it. Children are invited to the<br>office where respective employees personally hand over the gifts.<br>The smile on the faces of the children and the employees blossom<br>"The Wish Tree" into "A Smiley Tree" to commemorate the wishes<br>of the children come true.</p>
